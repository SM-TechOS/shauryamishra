	target= "_blank">website</a> for daily <br>news and about all things I got in Sainik School. I used <br>Javascript, Jsquery, Html and CSS to 
	build this Website.<br> I used <a href= "https://github.com/" style= "font-family: garamond; text-decoration: none;" target= "_blank">Github</a> to host this site fully free. <br>This site has many features such as our Notebook Editor, <br>In this
